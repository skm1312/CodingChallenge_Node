## CodingChallenge_Node

This is a Node App that handles GET requests dynamically based on the JSON file input. It takes a JSON file and the request parameters and matches them to retrieve the correct status code and information.

## How to run the code?

The major dependecies required are node, express and body-parser. It can be installed using npm. Place the json and the index.js in the same folder if required and then run the program using 

node index.js

This would start a server on localhost at port 8080. All the GET requests can be passed from here and the outputs can be verified.
